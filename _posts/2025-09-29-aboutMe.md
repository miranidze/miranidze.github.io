I am an agricultural economist and researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO), department of Agricultural Markets. 
My work primarily focuses on the functioning and efficiency of agricultural markets and value chains in transition economies, particularly post-Soviet countries, including Black Sea region and the South Caucasus. 
Recently, my research interests have expanded to include consumer behavior, international trade networks, and wine markets.
